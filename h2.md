* OWASP: OWASP Top 10: [A01 Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/) is a failure to enforce a policy where users cannot act outside of their intended permissions. Think of it like a hotel where your room key accidentally opens the penthouse, the manager's office, and the safe.
* Karvinen 2023: [Find Hidden Web Directories - Fuzz URLs with ffuf](https://terokarvinen.com/2023/fuzz-urls-find-hidden-directories/) Web servers often contain directories (like `/.svn/`, `/admin`, or `/backup`) that are not linked from the main homepage. Fuzzing is the automated process of testing thousands of possible directory names to find these hidden paths.
* PortSwigger: [Access control vulnerabilities and privilege escalation](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control) Access control is a security system that decides if a user has permission to view certain pages or perform specific actions. Problems occur when these rules are weak, allowing people to access private data or admin tools they should not see. For example, some users might find hidden links to change settings or view other people's personal accounts by changing simple details in a web address. To keep a website safe, developers should always block access by default and check every request carefully to make sure the user is truly allowed to be there.
* Karvinen 2006: [Report Writing (in Finnish)](https://terokarvinen.com/2006/raportin-kirjoittaminen-4/) Sorry, I have to skip this as my Finnish skill is not good enough to understand the whole report.
* Optional: PortSwigger 2020: [What is SQL injection? - Web Security Academy (about 10 min video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX6tszfgYp4) SQL injection is a dangerous security problem that happens when a person interferes with the commands a website sends to its database. By typing special characters, an attacker can trick the system into showing private information, such as other people's passwords or hidden product details. Sometimes, they can even log in as an administrator without knowing the correct password by making the system ignore the security checks. While some of these problems are easy to find, others are "blind" and require more complex methods like timing the website's response to guess the data. To prevent these attacks, developers should use a safe coding method called "parameterized queries," which ensures that user input is never treated as part of the actual database command.
